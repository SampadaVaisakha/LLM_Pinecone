This is the first Budget in Amrit \\nKaal . \\nIntroduction \\n1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous \\nBudget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous \\nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes.  \\n2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \\nthrough Sabka Prayas  resulting in Jan Bhagidari  and targeted support to \\nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire \\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges \\n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a \\nunique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. \\nWith the theme of ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ , we are steering an \\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \\nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind \\n7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a \\nbetter quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more \\nthan doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.   \\n8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from \\nbeing 10th to 5th largest in the world. We have significantly improved our \\nposition as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive \\nenvironment for business as reflected in several global indices.

The economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the \\nEPFO membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital \\npayments of ` 126 lakh crore through UPI in 2022.    \\n10. The efficient implementation of many schemes, with \\nuniversalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development. \\nSome of the schemes are: \\ni. 11.7 crore household toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission,  \\nii. 9.6 crore LPG connections under Ujjawala,  \\niii. 220 crore Covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,    \\niv. 47.8 crore PM Jan Dhan bank accounts, \\nv.

Our vision for the Amrit Kaal  includes technology-driven and \\nknowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust \\nfinancial sector. To achieve this, Jan Bhagidari through Sabka Saath Sabka \\nPrayas  is essential.   \\n12. The economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three \\nthings: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the \\nyouth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth \\nand job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.    \\n13.

This is the first Budget in Amrit \\nKaal . \\nIntroduction \\n1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous \\nBudget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous \\nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes.  \\n2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \\nthrough Sabka Prayas  resulting in Jan Bhagidari  and targeted support to \\nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire \\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges \\n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a \\nunique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. \\nWith the theme of ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ , we are steering an \\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \\nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind \\n7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a \\nbetter quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more \\nthan doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.   \\n8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from \\nbeing 10th to 5th largest in the world. We have significantly improved our \\nposition as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive \\nenvironment for business as reflected in several global indices.

The economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the \\nEPFO membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital \\npayments of ` 126 lakh crore through UPI in 2022.    \\n10. The efficient implementation of many schemes, with \\nuniversalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development. \\nSome of the schemes are: \\ni. 11.7 crore household toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission,  \\nii. 9.6 crore LPG connections under Ujjawala,  \\niii. 220 crore Covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,    \\niv. 47.8 crore PM Jan Dhan bank accounts, \\nv.

Our vision for the Amrit Kaal  includes technology-driven and \\nknowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust \\nfinancial sector. To achieve this, Jan Bhagidari through Sabka Saath Sabka \\nPrayas  is essential.   \\n12. The economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three \\nthings: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the \\nyouth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth \\nand job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.    \\n13.

I \\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily \\nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \\n146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax.  \\n147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \\n I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh Nil \\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \\nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-.

My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the \\nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \\npm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to \\nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh. \\n152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \\nregime.
